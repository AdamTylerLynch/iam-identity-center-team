# Temporary elevated access management (TEAM) for AWS IAM Identity Center
This repository contains the source code for deploying TEAM application.

TEAM is an open source solution that integrates with AWS IAM Identity Center and allows you to manage and monitor, time-bound elevated access to your multi-account AWS environment at scale.

The solution is a custom application that allows users to **request access to an AWS account** only when it is needed and only **for a specific period of time**. Once the time period has elapsed, elevated access is automatically removed.

Refer to the [blog post on the AWS Security Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/temporary-elevated-access-management-with-iam-identity-center/) for a background and an overview of the TEAM solution.
